## Project Overview
This project analyzes and manipulates data using Python and Jupyter notebooks, providing insights and verifying results. You can interact with the notebook to understand data transformations and explore different stages of analysis.

## Setup
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
   # For Windows:
   # .\env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dependencies
This project requires the following packages (list might vary based on your setup):

- Jupyter Notebook
- nbval
- pytest
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib (if visualization is used)

Make sure to have these packages installed either by using `requirements.txt` or by manually installing them with:
```bash
make install
```

## Notebook Structure
The notebook `Javidan_Karimli_IDS_706_CloudHostedDataAnalysis.ipynb` is organized into multiple sections:

1. **Data Loading**: Loads and preprocesses the dataset.
2. **Data Transformation**: Includes all transformation steps applied to the dataset.
3. **Data Analysis**: Analyzes the processed data and extracts insights.
4. **Testing**: Contains code for validating the integrity and correctness of the analysis.

## Usage
1. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Run the notebook**:
   In Jupyter, open `Javidan_Karimli_IDS_706_CloudHostedDataAnalysis.ipynb` and run the cells in sequence.

3. **Tag Specific Cells for Testing**:
   If you want to test specific cells, assign a tag like `test-me` in the cell toolbar.

## Testing
We use `pytest-nbval` to run tests on the notebook. You can run the tests using the following command:

```bash
make test_file
```

This will execute only the cells tagged with `test-me`, ensuring that specific sections of your notebook are verified.
